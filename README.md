# DDL-Constraints
This assignment aims to create a database called Sales and perform various SQL operations on a table named Orders. The task includes the use of constraints such as Primary Key, Unique, and Not Null on specific columns. We will perform the following operations:

Create the Orders table with the necessary columns.
Add a new column order_quantity to the Orders table.
Rename the table to sales_orders.
Insert 10 rows of sample data into the sales_orders table.
Retrieve the customer_name and Ordered_item from the table.
Use the UPDATE command to change the product name for any row.
Delete the sales_orders table from the database.
Screenshots of the results for each SQL command are attached for verification.

Screenshots of the results  are attached for reference. These screenshots visually demonstrate the successful execution of each SQL command.
